# POYO: A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding

POYO (Azabou et al 2023, NeurIPS) introduces a new transformer-based framework for neural population decoding, designed to adapt rapidly to new, unseen sessions with minimal labels, leveraging large-scale neural recordings. Read here for a [high-level intro to POYO](https://poyo-brain.github.io/).

This repository contains code from the POYO paper, which is a part of the [Neuro-Galaxy](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy) project.

## Installation Instructions
